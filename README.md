# Scan WiFi networks on button press

## Overview

This app demonstrates how to scan for available WiFi networks. WiFi scan
is triggered by a button press.

On NodeMCU and DevKitC, a button pin is already configured to pin 0,
which is a "Flash" button.
If you have your button on another GPIO pin, go to the configuration,
expert view, and change the pin number:

```
  "my_app": {
    "button_pin": 0
  }
```

Press on a button. You should see WiFi network list appearing on
your console:
